To compile the slides:

> xelatex tex.beamer.tex

and repeat twice more.

To compile the handout version

> xelatex tex.handout.tex

and repeat twice more.

Some of the contents are out-of-dated now, e.g. no xelatex and xeCJK here. Because the slides are written more than 5 years ago.

Now I update it to compiled with xelatex, and will update the contents as soon as I have enough time.
